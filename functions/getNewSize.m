function [newH, newW, x1, y1, x2, y2] = getNewSize(transform, h2, w2, h1, w1)
% Calculate the size of new mosaic
% Input:
% transform - homography matrix
% h1 - height of the unwarped image
% w1 - width of the unwarped image
% h2 - height of the warped image
% w2 - height of the warped image
% Output:
% newH - height of the new image
% newW - width of the new image
% x1 - x coordate of lefttop corner of new image
% y1 - y coordate of lefttop corner of new image
% x2 - x coordate of lefttop corner of unwarped image
% y2 - y coordate of lefttop corner of unwarped image
